the attributes are a matrix, crossing realm (body-mind-spirit) with type (power-control-resistance-recovery).

Consider a resource pool for each realm. 
I'm already thinking about:
* SP (stamina pool) - this is body-oriented, for combat and movement and physical active or toggleable skills or actions
* MP (mojo pool) [mojo is shorthand for one of magical, mystical, mental, miracle] - this is spirit-oriented, for mojo actions and effects
could add
* FP (focus pool) - this is mind-oriented, for non-physical active or toggle-able skills or actions


Develop this idea further when getting into skills and such....
